%vectfield  vector field for system of 2 first order ODEs
%   vectfield(func,y1val,y2val) plots the vector field for the system of 
%   two first order ODEs given by func, using the grid of y1val and 
%   y2 values given by the vectors y1val and y2val. func is either a 
%   the name of an inline function of two variables, or a string 
%   with the name of an m-file.
%   By default, t=0 is used in func. A t value can be specified as an
%   additional argument: vectfield(func,y1val,y2val,t)
