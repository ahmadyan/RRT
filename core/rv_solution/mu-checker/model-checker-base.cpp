// An abstract model checker
// The model checker checks, possibly incrementally, whether the graph
// maintained by the planner algorithm contains a trajectory that
// solves the problem at hand. In particular, a model checker may check
// whether there exists a trajectory that reaches a goal region. More
// generally, the model checker can evaluate whether the graph includes
// a trajectory that satisfies a temporal logic specification.
